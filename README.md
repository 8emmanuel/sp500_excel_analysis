The data is sourced from [Kaggle: S&P 500 Companies with Financial Information](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets). It includes:

- Company Name
- Sector 
- Market Capitalization
- PE Ratio (Price-to-Earnings)
- Dividend Yield
- EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization)
- Additional financial metrics

The Excel workbook contains:

- Data cleaning and preparation steps
- Pivot tables summarizing average market cap, dividend yield, EBITDA, and company counts by sector
- Pivot Charts with majority sector related visualizations


The S&P 500 dataset from Kaggle lacked key information such as industry classifications and year / date fields. This prevented the creation of interactive filters by industry or time, limiting me to static analysis rather than dynamic, sliceable dashboards. Nevertheless, this project provided an enjoyable opportunity to explore Excelâ€™s capabilities in organizing data, as well as in creating tables and charts to effectively visualize trends.
